Firstly, I will ask you to watch the great talk from Simon Sinek, I am waiting you back:<br/>

So let's start with why;
## Why ?
I come from an engnnering background, with a specialization in mechatronics and robotics.<br/>
Two years ago, I was working on my graduation project, where I had to control a robotic arm to acheive standard tasks inside its work space. At that time, we have manufactured a custom robotic arm by using laser cutting machines. It worked at the end, for the first milestone, we can send commends to the motors and it moves.<br/>
The next ste is to acheive a task using our robotic arm, in the theory of the robotic control, we need the dynamic model of our robot. Depending on the dynamic model we can build the needed control system to acheive the tasks, but in our situation, the errors and approximation in the dynamic model affected very bad, so the results was unstisfying.<br/>
We have aproblem, how to solve it, we need an algorithm that can handle
