Firstly, I will ask you to watch this great talk from Simon Sinek, I am waiting you back:<br/>

So let's start with why;
## Why ?
I come from an engnnering background, with a specialization in mechatronics and robotics.<br/>
Two years ago, I was working on my graduation project, where I had to control a robotic arm to acheive standard tasks inside its work space. At that time, we have manufactured a custom robotic arm by using laser cutting machines. It worked at the end, for the first milestone, we can send commends to the motors and it moves.<br/>
The next ste is to acheive a task using our robotic arm, in the theory of the robotic control, we need the dynamic model of our robot. Depending on the dynamic model we can build the needed control system to acheive the tasks, but in our situation, the errors and approximation in the dynamic model affected very bad, so the results was unstisfying.<br/>
We have a problem, and to solve it, we need an algorithm that can handle such approximations and errors. 

## How ?
How to solve the problem, we have read about the possible solution, but the results of most of the past work shows that, it hard to make something like that work with a robot.<br/>
But one day, in May 2017. I was watching Google I/O 2017, where was a lecture about using deep neural network to map directly from images to labels. Here, I had thought, why we can't use that in robotic, a deep neural network that maps between motor torques and the end effector poisition.<br/>
The previous notice, led me to research about such mehtods, and to find that, this idea already a hot research topic, and it is called "**Reinforcement learning**".<br/>
It was the starting point for my research journey, I have worked firstly with model free algorithms like DDPG, TRPO, PPO. But in robotics, it is impracrtical to let the robot work for weeks to collect the big datasets which is needed to train deep neural networks. here I have decided to work with "**data-efficient reinforcement learning**"

## What?
Using probabilistic models of the environment could lead to a better data efficiency. That fact has been visited when using Gaussian processes in model-based RL ([PILCO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02860)), and when using Bayesian Gaussian processes ([Deep PILCO](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/yarin/PDFs/DeepPILCO.pdf))
